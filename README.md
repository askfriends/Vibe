# üìΩÔ∏è Vibe

Video streaming app powered by Google Drive, Electron, React and Mpv.js (libmpv).

#### Require: Authentication with a Google Drive Account 

Why?
- To use Google Drive API for downloading/streaming videos
- To take advantage of Google Drive overpowered CDN
- To bypass Google Drive file download limitation, the app will copy the file into the user's Google Drive account.
